# Introduction
This is an intermediate guide on how to engineer a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application using Node.js and MongoDB.  Sections of this guide will lead engineers through a task list that defines the baseline of requirements to a CRM application.  In section one learn about creating a secure web based application interface for users to begin using CRM application services with.  In section two build interfaces that the customers and administrators will use to manage profiles.  In section three allow users and administrator to begin editing the database and restrict access to of the functions that grant users database access.  The last section of this guide is optional to readers but highly suggested as it covers the importance of guaranteeing software quality.  At the end of this guide readers will have the knowledge and code for a baseline template that can be integrated to future CRM projects.

## About Lesson Plans
### Section One Lesson Plan
Starting with the first lesson of this guide, learn how to generate and structure a application for testing, readability and maintainability with the Express framework.  In addition, understand the concepts chosen to secure a userâ€™s web connection and how to apply some of the most reliable standards currently known.  

### Section Two Lesson Plan
With a secure connection in place move on to learning how the Jade Template Engine works with the Express and Bootstrap frameworks to create an attractive interactive interface.   Stages in this section will produce three work products that represent both functional and nonfunctional requirements of navigation setting and views for customers and administrators that product owners can evaluate. 

### Section Three Lesson Plan
In this lesson plan readers will create a structure that facilitates data interactions to the user and prepares the CRM for static testing in section four.  Finlay by applying the Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) principles of database management, complete the application requirement of the CRM.  

### Section Four Lesson Plan
In the last part of this guide I provide an optional lesson on verification and validation processes that can be solved by programming.  These are the founding principles of software quality that will be used to guarantee the CRM capabilities are maintained though its development life cycle.

## Who is it for?
This guide is for persons who wish to learn the general concepts needed to engineer an application in Node.js and use MongoDB manage data.  It has a particular emphasis on applying technologies that increase mobile connectivity and web security.  User categories that may be interested in the lessons contained in this guide are: 

  * Intermediate / Independent Developers
  * Front-end / Back-end Developers
  * Software Engineers
  * Software Quality Assurance Engineers

## What do I need to know?
This tutorial is intended for a person containing intermediate programming knowledge of Node.js and web based languages and scripts. More specifically it is best suited for users with general knowledge of the following:

  * Node.js
  * Express
