## About Guide
This tutorial is an intermediate guide on how to engineer a user authentication and management system or more commonly known as a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system using Node.js and MongoDB.  Starting with the first lesson of this guide, learn how to generate and form a projects base and structure for testing, readability and maintainability.  Once a projects baseline template is generated create a connection with the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) that meets the development, testing and implementation cycles needs.  With a secure connection in place move on to learn how to use the Jade Template Engine effectively with Express and Bootstrap frameworks.  Finlay by applying  the Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) principles of database management we will fulfill the requirements needed to complete our CRM. When all the steps needed to engineer a secure user authentication and management system are complete; developers will have a baseline template to integrate or build on for future CRM based projects.
