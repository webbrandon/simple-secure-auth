## About Guide
This tutorial is an intermediate guide on how to engineer a user authentication and management system or more commonly known as a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application using Node.js and MongoDB.  Starting with the first lesson of this guide, learn how to generate and structure the application for testing, readability and maintainability in addition to creating and understanding the concepts chosen to secure the web connection.  With a secure connection in place move on to learn how to use the Jade Template Engine with the Express and Bootstrap frameworks to create an attractive interactive interface.  Finlay by applying  the Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) principles of database management complete the application requirement of the CRM application. In the last part of this guide I provide an optional lesson on verification and validation processes that can be solved by  programming.  When all the steps needed to engineer a secure user authentication and management system are complete; developers will have a baseline template to integrate or build on for future CRM based projects.
